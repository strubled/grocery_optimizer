## Working On

- Bulk Add: Add a bunch of items to a list quickly
- Search on All Items: It's got two search buttons because I'm trying to figure out how to accept search parameters from the text box or the drop-down
- Duplicates: You can in weird situations add a duplicate item
- Weird Errors: I've been using this while shopping and sometimes find times where I can't "buy" an item, also that items appear they should be on the weekslist (they are indicated as such in All Items) but don't appear
- Quick Edit: Would like to be able to click on any text input to reveal edit ability
- Edit Returns to Page: When you edit an item, it stays on the Edit page vs. sending you back to All Items
